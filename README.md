# AljabarLinear_Invers_Determinnat_LInearSystemSolver

pre midterm Assignment, create or search a program about linear system

# Note

Might require visual studio ide 2019 to run.
Require Asspose.Cell.Cpp library to run properly
(another way : can be fix by deleting the function related to reading file from excel)

# Bonus

There is a file name "Data_Set_Generator.m" to generate inversible matrix by NxN size (N is inputtable by user)
(Note : Require Cuda and matlab with "parallel computing toolbox" add ons)
